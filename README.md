# hi, i’m Nhi 👋

I’m a Stats + CS student at UIUC (math minor), applying for PhD programs in the **2026 cycle**.  
I like problems where randomness has rules — and where “good results” don’t count unless the evaluation survives reality checks.

I bounce between:
- **probability / stochastic processes** (randomness with structure)
- **statistical learning + inference** (generalization, uncertainty, diagnostics)
- **quant / market microstructure** (limit order books, signal vs overfitting, costs, regimes)

## what i’m working on
- **market microstructure experiments**: LOB features → prediction → signals → backtests  
  *(walk-forward splits, transaction costs, leakage checks, drawdown/turnover — i’m picky about this stuff)*
- **MCMC mixing**: MH vs Gibbs, tuning + diagnostics (the “why is my chain stuck?” problem)
- **random hypergraphs**: thresholds + algorithmic limits (OGP-style reasoning)

## how i like to work
clean baselines first, then fancier models. if it’s not reproducible, i don’t trust it.

## tools
Python • C++ • R • SQL • NumPy/pandas/Polars • Monte Carlo/MCMC • LaTeX • Linux • Git/Docker
